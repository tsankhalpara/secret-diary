### Test Drive the Secret Diary

```
SecretDiary
  - lock
  - unlock
  - add_entry
  - get_entries

Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.

When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.

When the user calls `lock` again they throw errors again.
